# Version 2 â€“ Dynamic Memory Allocation
This version of the image processing program uses **Dynamic Memory Allocation** to store and manipulate image data. It demonstrates proficient use of `malloc()` and Valgrind.

### Features
- Uses `malloc()` to allocate image data dynamically at runtime
- Emphasizes pointer arithmetic and dynamic resizing
- Text based menu

### Learning Highlights
- Introduction to **dynamic memory allocation** in C
- Used **Valgrind** to detect memory-related errors
- Use of **makefiles** for automating compilation and managing multiple source files

Note: This is a simplified version of a project developed for EECS22 at the University of California, Irvine. Some files have been omitted. What you see here only highlights the most important elements.
