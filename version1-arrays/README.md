# Version 1 â€“ Arrays
This version of the image processing program uses **static arrays** to store and manipulate image data. It demonstrates basic image handling techniques in C using fixed-size 2D arrays.

### Features
- Stores image pixel data in a 2D array
- Simple image operations
- Text-based menu

### Learning Highlights
- Introduction to image representation in C
- Modular program structure with **header and source files**
- Use of **makefiles** for automating compilation and managing multiple source files  

Note: This is a simplified version of a project developed for EECS22 at the University of California, Irvine. Some files have been omitted. What you see here only highlights the most important elements.
